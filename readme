TODO
-- main aim is to: 
    - provide the infrastructure to merge knowledge into an existing answer
    - maintain version controlling with merged answers and allow upvoting and downvoting on the tree
-- rewrite substantial portions of Lib.js - discard readFileSync()
-- to build a lightweight & performant framework, contribute to Midnqp/Frameworkless.
    - Don't repeat yourself. A framework that ensures maximum code reuse.
    - Midnqp/Frameworkless will provide auto-mailing, cron, cumulative updates
    - Standard Laravel features, or React features like DOM changes' pre-calculations, pushState.
-- UI will be monospaced & lightweight



CONTRIBUTIONS
Any idea/contribution is always warmly welcomed.
