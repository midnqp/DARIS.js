--------PRINCIPLES--------
* Least polymorphism.

* The aim is to formulate & contribute to alhamd-vanilla to build applications in 03 days. So, we provide toolings: (1) EmbeddedNodejs. {thought#1}

* If you don't know what more shall be done to a project, then, well, go take a walk!

* Try enclosing code in functions. That allows reuse. Try to invoke many of them under a certain function. That helps to recreate the thought-process easy.


----CODE AND PLANS----
** `./blog/write/` requires userrole=admin. So if userrole != admin, show 404.
** Remember? Use variables in an array like `globals['gvar1'] = 77;`. In Node.js, you can store functions too, remember?
`const globals = {
	var1		:		1,
	fun1		: function(param1, param2) {... return x;}
};`


----DESIGN OF DARISONE----
* Font is always Monospace. Maintain variants, of course. Least solid color fills. No elements with enclosed color-fills, like <button>. Forget 'em. Just do "texts" and onclick and hover.








--------GETTING STARTED--------


--DATABASE--

```````````````````````````````
create database `daris`;
use `daris`;


create table `ques`
(
    `qid`    INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
    `uid`    INT NOT NULL,
    `qtitle` VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
    `qup`    INT NOT NULL,
    `qdown`  INT NOT NULL,
    `qtime`  DATETIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`qid`)
) ENGINE = MyISAM;


create table `ans`
(
    `aid`    INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
    `uid`    INT NOT NULL,
    `atext`  VARCHAR(5000) NOT NULL,
    `aup`    INT NOT NULL,
    `adown`  INT NOT NULL,
    `atime`  DATETIME NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`aid`)
) ENGINE = MyISAM;


# How to store the list of qid?
#-> space-separated 
#aqids = All (asked) Question IDs
#aaids = All (answered) Answer IDs
create table `users`
(
    `uid`       INT NOT NULL auto_increment,
		`role`			VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    `aqids`      VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    `aaids` VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`)
) ENGINE = MyISAM;

--------THOUGHTS--------
[1] I really do not want to mess my code up with HTML like PHP. It looks disgusting. Express.render(view, data) really does "replace" strings (aha!!), but in a systematic & messy way.
`enodejs` would:
		- make HTML files big. 
		- make very easy to build webpages specific for users/questions/answers.
		- make me think smart & calm.
